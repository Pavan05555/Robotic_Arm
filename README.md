# Robotic Arm Control Using Arduino and Bluetooth  

Welcome to the **Robotic Arm Control** project repository! This project demonstrates how to build and control a robotic arm using an **Arduino Uno**, **servo motors**, and an **HC-05 Bluetooth module**. The robotic arm can be wirelessly controlled via a mobile phone, allowing you to rotate the base, move the arm forward/backward, up/down, and open/close the clamp to grip objects.  

## üõ†Ô∏è **Components Used**  
- Arduino Uno  
- 4 Servo Motors  
  - 1 for base rotation (0 to 180 degrees)  
  - 2 for arm movement (forward, backward, up, and down)  
  - 1 for clamp control (open and close)  
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module  
- Jumper Wires  
- Power Supply  

## üì± **How It Works**  
The robotic arm is controlled wirelessly using a mobile phone. The HC-05 Bluetooth module receives commands from the phone and sends them to the Arduino, which then controls the servo motors to perform the desired actions.  

## üöÄ **Features**  
- Wireless control via Bluetooth.  
- Precise control over servo motors for smooth movements.  
- Ability to rotate, move, and grip objects.  
- Easy-to-use interface for controlling the arm.  

## üîß **Setup Instructions**  
1. **Hardware Setup**:  
   - Connect the servo motors to the Arduino as per the wiring diagram.  
   - Connect the HC-05 Bluetooth module to the Arduino.  
   - Ensure the power supply is sufficient to run all components.  

2. **Software Setup**:  
   - Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino Uno.  
   - Pair your mobile phone with the HC-05 Bluetooth module.  
   - Use a Bluetooth terminal app on your phone to send commands to the robotic arm.  

3. **Control the Arm**:  
   - Use the app to send commands for base rotation, arm movement, and clamp control.
